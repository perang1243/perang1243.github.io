    <h1>Early signs of neurotypicallisim and what to do about it</h1>
    <h2>Davin Ward</h2>

    <p>If you suspect you or your child is nurologically typical, you must confirm this immediatly. First observe your child and confirm if they exhibit the following signs of neurotypicallisim:</p>
    <br>
    <p>(1) Strange methods of communication, including, but not limited to: looking at the eyes of other neurotypics, small talk (outlined in more detail on symptom 8), and hand gestures.</p>
    <p>(2) Needs to be touched. Does not stiffen or stress out upon contact with another person.</p>
    <p>(3) A "sixth sense." Clear ability to understand when to inerject in a group conversasion without inturrupting someone.</p>
    <p>(4) Uses nonscensical phrases to convey emotion. Common exaples include "you are the apple of my eye" and "I've got you under my skin."</p>
    <p>(5) Unhealthy craving for human interaction. Does not get anxious when in close proximity to strangers, and will oftentimes engage in unsoliced coversation.</p>
    <p>(6) Inability to feel anxiety in places where nessacary. Comfortable in social situations, including ones with loud music, bright lights, and lots of people.</p>
    <p>(7) Unhealthy craving for socializing. Does not do well alone; needs constant socializing and playing with other people.</p>
    <p>(8) When speaking, the child may do a strange ritual with other neurotypics known as "small talk." A pointless exercise that has the neurotypics talk about meaningless, boring topics insted of going to the important part of the conversation.</p>
    <p>(9) Inability to be particulary creative or logical. Seems to be somwhere inbetween making the child virtually usless in both fields.</p>
    <p>(10) Is able to start and finish projects with relative ease requiring no prior motivation to get started and/or a long push to get in the zone, at the same time finishing in a timeley manner.</p>
    <p>(11) Strange ability to understand and comfort another person. Is able to undertand why a person is feeling sad or anxious easily and make them not feel that way anymore.</p>
    <p>(12) Unhealthy lack of stimming. Rarley stims when bored or stressed, and finds other interesting and potentially dangerous coping methods such as talking to friends and family</p>
    <br>
    <p>If your child has these symptoms, they are likely neurologically typical. Unfourtonataley, we have no cure for this horrible disease, but your child can learn to interact normally with neurodivergents and still live a relativley normal life. The best advice is to allow them to participate in these strange social rituals with other neurotypical peers as not to make them feel to lonley or withdrawn. Allow them to socilize often or they may become depressed. If those symptoms sound scary, it is because they are, but your child can still fuction well with  other neurodivergents. If you need further help, contact a neurotypical professional care worker near you for any questions. You can get through this.</p>
