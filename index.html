          <h2>What is PISNT?</h2>
          <p>PISNT, an offshoot of the now disbanded ISNT (Institute for the Study of the Neurologically Typical) is hoping to continue reaserch on these strange people known as neurotypicals. The original website for ISNT no longer exists, and we are only left with the web archive to supply us with neurotypical knowlage, but I feel that we should work to continue studying these strange people. I only hope that, one day, we will be able to finally find the scource of the cause of neurotypicalisim. I will be using text from many of ISNTs sudies an their website.</p>

          <p>We where founded by scientist Jack Mehof and Rep. Dwink Bexon (ANP). The lead programmer and co-scientist was Rep. Davin Ward (DSP). We are a nonprofit hoping to advance the study of the neurotypical people. Special thanks to Perang Science Association for aiding and funding reaserch on this project,</p>

          <h2>What is a neurotypical?</h2>
          <p>Neurotypical syndrome is a neurobiological disorder characterized by preoccupation with social concerns, delusions of superiority, and obsession with conformity.</p> 
          <p>Neurotypical individuals often assume that their experience of the world is either the only one, or the only correct one. NTs find it difficult to be alone. NTs are often intolerant of seemingly minor differences in others. When in groups NTs are socially and behaviorally rigid, and frequently insist upon the performance of dysfunctional, destructive, and even impossible rituals as a way of maintaining group identity. NTs find it difficult to communicate directly, and have a much higher incidence of lying as compared to persons on the autistic spectrum.</p> 
          <p>NT is believed to be genetic in origin. Autopsies have shown the brain of the neurotypical is typically smaller than that of an autistic individual and may have overdeveloped areas related to social behavior.</p>

          <h2>How many people are neurotypical</h2>
          <p>about 70 - 80% of the world is neurotypical depending on the source, some sources even estimating as low as 38%. Hopefully, one day, that number will be 0.</p>
