      <h1>The neurotypical test</h1>
      <p>The neurotypical test is a highly evidence based test formulated by a top teir team of scientists to test if you are neurotypical or not. The test propts you with different situations, and you have to click the answer that best represents how you would react in these situations. Then, a very complex mathematical formula decides if you are or aren't neurotypical. This is a revised version of the original ISNT test.</p>
